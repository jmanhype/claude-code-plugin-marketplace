```
[Release] Multi-Agent Intelligence Marketplace - 19 Production-Grade Claude Code Plugins
```

**Body:**
```markdown
Hey r/ClaudeAI!

I just released a Claude Code plugin marketplace with 19 production-grade plugins built from my multi-agent trading system.

## 🎯 What's Included

**Featured plugins:**
- **quant-trading-system** - Complete trading stack with risk management, circuit breakers, kill switches, and pre/post trade hooks
- **research-execution-pipeline** - DSPy-powered research pipeline with GEPA optimization methodology
- **github-automation-suite** - 13 specialized GitHub agents for PR management, code reviews, issue tracking, and releases
- **swarm-coordination** - Adaptive/hierarchical/mesh swarm patterns with self-organizing capabilities

**Complete plugin list (19 total):**
- Trading & Research (3 plugins)
- GitHub Automation (2 plugins)
- Swarm Intelligence (3 plugins)
- Development Tools (5 plugins)
- Distributed Systems (3 plugins)
- Specialized Systems (3 plugins)

## 💎 What Makes This Different

Most Claude Code plugins are great general-purpose tools. Mine are built from a production trading system that handles real money:

- **Battle-tested safety infrastructure** - Circuit breakers that auto-switch to paper trading on errors
- **Complete vertical integration** - From research to execution, all in production
- **Real risk management** - Multi-layer validation, position sizing, stop losses
- **Not demos** - These agents run my actual crypto trading systems

## 🏗️ Built From

68+ specialized agents organized into:
- Risk management & position sizing
- DSPy-powered strategy optimization
- Distributed consensus (Byzantine, Raft, CRDT, Gossip)
- Swarm coordination patterns
- GitHub workflow automation
- And much more...

## 🚀 Installation

```bash
/plugin marketplace add jmanhype/claude-code-plugins

**Title:**
```
[Open Source] Production Multi-Agent Trading System Plugins for Claude Code
```

**Body:**
```markdown
I've been building multi-agent trading systems for crypto markets and just open-sourced the core components as Claude Code plugins.

## What I'm Sharing

**quant-trading-system plugin** - Complete trading infrastructure including:
- Risk manager with multi-layer validation
- Circuit breakers (auto paper-mode on errors)
- Kill switches for emergency stops
- Pre/post trade hooks
- CCXT exchange integration
- Metrics tracking

**research-execution-pipeline plugin** - DSPy-powered research system:
- Automated strategy discovery
- GEPA optimization methodology
- Continuous backtesting
- Benchmark-gated promotion (only promote strategies that beat current winner)

Plus 17 other plugins for swarm intelligence, GitHub automation, distributed systems, etc.

## Production Experience

These aren't academic demos - I run these systems with real money on crypto markets:

- Safety-first design (circuit breakers saved me multiple times)
- Complete separation: LLM for research only, deterministic execution for live
- Append-only evidence logs for forensics
- PR-gated promotion to production

## Why Claude Code Plugins?

I wanted to make these systems more accessible. Instead of you having to understand my entire codebase, you can:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add jmanhype/claude-code-plugins
/plugin install quant-trading-system
```

And get production-tested trading infrastructure ready to go.

## What You Get

- 68+ specialized agents
- Complete safety infrastructure
- Real risk management (not just position sizing)
- Battle-tested in production
- All open source (MIT license)

## Links

- **Marketplace**: https://github.com/jmanhype/claude-code-plugins
- **Source Code**: https://github.com/jmanhype/multi-agent-system
- **Docs**: Quick start, deployment guides, examples

Happy to discuss the architecture, design decisions, or anything else about building production trading systems with AI agents.

✅ Real domain expertise (not general demos)

Key features:

🤖 68+ specialized agents
📊 DSPy-powered research pipelines
🔒 Comprehensive safety systems
🐝 Swarm intelligence patterns
🔄 GitHub automation (13 agents)

## 🎬 Dev.to Blog Post (Title + Intro)

**Title:**
```
Building a Production Multi-Agent Trading System: From Research to Open Source
```

**Intro:**
```markdown
I spent the last year building multi-agent systems for cryptocurrency trading. Today, I'm open-sourcing the core infrastructure as 19 Claude Code plugins.

This isn't another "I built a chatbot" story. This is about designing systems that handle real money, with real risk, where mistakes cost you immediately.

Here's what I learned, and what I'm sharing with the community.

## The Problem

Most AI agent frameworks are built for demos. They're impressive, but they fall apart when you need:
- Real safety mechanisms
- Production risk management
- Deterministic execution
- Forensic logging
- Emergency controls

I needed all of that for trading.

## The Solution

Multi-Agent Intelligence Marketplace - 19 plugins built from 68+ specialized agents:
