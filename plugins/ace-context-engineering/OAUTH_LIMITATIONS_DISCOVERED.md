# OAuth Limitations for ACE CI/CD

## üî¥ Critical Discovery

After implementing OAuth-based workflows for ACE, we've discovered fundamental limitations:

## The Problem

### 1. Anthropic API Doesn't Accept OAuth Tokens Directly

**Error from workflow run #18859948465:**
```json
{
  "type": "error",
  "error": {
    "type": "authentication_error",
    "message": "OAuth authentication is currently not supported."
  },
  "request_id": "req_011CUYeACPUxZJR2Edsd1tsM"
}
```

**What this means:**
- OAuth tokens from claude-code-login work ONLY through claude-code-action
- Direct API calls to `https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages` with Bearer OAuth token fail
- There's no way to use OAuth tokens outside of claude-code-action's proxy layer

### 2. claude-code-action Doesn't Support workflow_dispatch

**Error from workflow run #18859846337:**
```
Error: Prepare step failed with error: Unsupported event type: workflow_dispatch
```

**Supported events (from README):**
- ‚úÖ `pull_request` - PR opened/synchronized
- ‚úÖ `issue_comment` - Comments on issues/PRs
- ‚úÖ `issues` - Issues opened/assigned
- ‚úÖ `pull_request_review` - PR reviews submitted
- ‚ùå `workflow_dispatch` - Manual triggers (coming soon)
- ‚ùå `repository_dispatch` - Custom events (coming soon)
- ‚ùå `schedule` - Cron schedules (not mentioned)

### 3. The Impasse

```
OAuth Tokens
    ‚Üì
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí Anthropic API directly? ‚ùå "OAuth not supported"
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí claude-code-action proxy? ‚úÖ Works
    ‚îÇ       ‚Üì
    ‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚Üí workflow_dispatch? ‚ùå "Unsupported event type"
    ‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚Üí schedule (cron)? ‚ùå Requires workflow_dispatch-like behavior
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚Üí No way to run automated/scheduled benchmarks
```

## What We Tried

### Attempt 1: Direct OAuth Token Usage (FAILED)
**File:** `.github/workflows/ace-benchmark-simple.yml`

```yaml
env:
  CLAUDE_ACCESS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CLAUDE_ACCESS_TOKEN }}

# Python code:
headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {access_token}",
    "anthropic-version": "2023-06-01",
    "content-type": "application/json"
}

response = requests.post(
    "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages",
    headers=headers,
    json=payload
)
```

**Result:** HTTP 401 - "OAuth authentication is currently not supported."

### Attempt 2: claude-code-action with workflow_dispatch (FAILED)
**File:** `.github/workflows/ace-benchmark.yml`

```yaml
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      num_tasks:
        type: string

uses: grll/claude-code-action@beta
with:
  use_oauth: true
  claude_access_token: ${{ secrets.CLAUDE_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
  # ...
```

**Result:** "Unsupported event type: workflow_dispatch"

### Attempt 3: Issue-Based Trigger (PARTIAL SUCCESS)
**File:** `.github/workflows/claude_code.yml`

```yaml
on:
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]

if: contains(github.event.comment.body, '@claude')

uses: grll/claude-code-action@beta
```

**Result:** ‚úÖ Works when user comments "@claude run ACE benchmarks"

## Viable Workarounds

### Option A: Issue-Based Automation (RECOMMENDED)

**How it works:**
1. Create a scheduled workflow that creates an issue
2. Issue contains "@claude" mention with instructions
3. claude-code-action responds to issue
4. Close issue after completion

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Uses OAuth (no API key needed)
- ‚úÖ Fully automated with cron schedule
- ‚úÖ Works with claude-code-action

**Cons:**
- Creates noise (one issue per run)
- Requires cleanup workflow

**Implementation:**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/ace-schedule-trigger.yml
name: ACE Scheduled Trigger

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * *'

jobs:
  create-issue:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Create Issue
        uses: actions/github-script@v7
        with:
          script: |
            await github.rest.issues.create({
              owner: context.repo.owner,
              repo: context.repo.repo,
              title: `ACE Benchmark Run ${new Date().toISOString()}`,
              body: `@claude Run ACE benchmarks on 3 tasks from dev split.`
            });
```

### Option B: Native Claude CLI Integration

The claude-code-action README says Anthropic added OAuth natively:

```
## UPDATE (2025-07-08)

Anthropic finally brought that capabilities natively making this repository obselete.

You can uninstall everything as simply as you installed it using the uninstaller:

bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grll/claude-code-action/main/scripts/uninstaller.sh)

Then you can install the github action / token secret directly via the claude code cli:

claude
/install-github-app     Set up Claude GitHub Actions for a repository
> Create a long-lived token with your Claude subscription üëà
```

**This suggests:**
1. Anthropic has native long-lived tokens for Claude Max
2. These may work with standard claude-code-action
3. Might support more event types

**Action required:**
```bash
claude
/install-github-app
# Select: "Create a long-lived token with your Claude subscription"
```

### Option C: Get API Key

If OAuth truly cannot work for scheduled automation:
1. Go to console.anthropic.com
2. Add billing to account
3. Generate API key
4. Use in workflows

**But:** User explicitly said NO API KEYS

## Anthropic's OAuth Implementation Gap

**Observation:** Anthropic's OAuth implementation appears incomplete for programmatic access:

1. ‚úÖ OAuth works for interactive Claude Max usage
2. ‚úÖ OAuth works through claude-code-action proxy (PR/issue events only)
3. ‚ùå OAuth doesn't work with Anthropic API directly
4. ‚ùå OAuth tokens have no documented direct API usage path

**This suggests:** OAuth was designed for interactive usage (web/CLI), not programmatic API access.

## Recommendation

**Best path forward for ACE CI/CD:**

1. **Short term:** Use Option A (issue-based automation)
   - Implement scheduled issue creation
   - Use "@claude" mentions for automation
   - Accept the noise of issues

2. **Medium term:** Try Option B (native CLI tokens)
   - Test if `/install-github-app` creates different tokens
   - Verify if these work with more event types
   - Document findings

3. **Long term:** Wait for Anthropic
   - Direct OAuth API support may come later
   - `workflow_dispatch` support may be added to claude-code-action
   - Monitor both repositories for updates

## Files Created

- ‚úÖ `.github/workflows/claude_code_login.yml` - OAuth token generation
- ‚úÖ `.github/workflows/claude_code.yml` - Issue/PR automation
- ‚úÖ `.github/workflows/ace-benchmark.yml` - Attempted workflow_dispatch (FAILED)
- ‚úÖ `.github/workflows/ace-benchmark-simple.yml` - Attempted direct OAuth (FAILED)

## Next Steps

1. Implement Option A (issue-based scheduling)
2. Test Option B (native CLI tokens)
3. Document which approach works

---

**Status**: OAuth limitations discovered
**Blocking Issue**: No way to run scheduled workflows with OAuth-only approach
**User Requirement**: No API keys allowed
**Viable Solution**: Issue-based automation (creates noise but works)
