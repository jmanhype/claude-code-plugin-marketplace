---

### Added

#### Core QTS Infrastructure (19 files)

**Trading Pipeline (`qts/`)**
- `qts/main.py` - Single-tick trading loop with market data â†’ LLM â†’ risk â†’ execution â†’ logging
- `qts/risk.py` - Multi-layer risk manager with 9+ violation types

- `qts/bullets.py` - ACE (Agentic Context Engineering) bullet logging system
- `qts/tournament.py` - Tournament system for multi-variant paper trading validation
- `qts/__init__.py` - Package initialization with v1.0.0 marker

**Risk Management**
- Per-symbol leverage caps (BTC/ETH: 1.5x, others: 1.2x)
- Gross leverage limit (1.0x portfolio-wide)
- Position sizing limits (25% per symbol, 100% gross notional)

- Daily loss limit (-5%) with auto-flatten and cooldown
- Maximum drawdown circuit breaker (-10% emergency halt)
- Order rate limiting (30 orders/minute)
- Circuit breaker with 60-minute cooldown

**Execution & Safety**
- Paper trading as default (live requires 3-layer approval)
- Realistic slippage simulation (50-200ms latency, Â±20 bps slippage)
- Live trading disabled by default with explicit `enabled=True` flag requirement
- CCXT integration ready (testnet support)
- Fill tracking with latency measurement

**ACE Bullet Logging**
- Complete stateâ†’actionâ†’result capture

- Relationship edges (led_to, confirmed_by, invalidated_by, same_regime_as)
- Tag-based filtering (symbol, decision type, rejection status)
- JSON storage with deterministic IDs
- Query interface for analysis and learning

**Tournament System**
- Multi-variant paper trading (e.g., tp_trail_1.0x, tp_trail_1.5x, tp_trail_2.0x)
- Daily leaderboard with key metrics:
  - Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio
  - Maximum drawdown (MDD)
  - Hit rate, average hold time
  - Violations and reject rate
- 4-week promotion gates:
  - Sharpe > 1.2
  - MDD < 10%
  - Hit rate > 45%
  - Trades/week > 20
  - Zero violations
- Deterministic RNG per variant for reproducibility

### Changed

#### Bug Fixes (Commit 3)

**ExecutionResult Structure**
- Fixed: `ExecutionResult` now properly initializes with `success=False` by default
- Fixed: `add_fill()` method correctly sets `success=True` when fills are added
- Impact: Prevents false positives in execution success tracking

**Notional Calculation**
- Fixed: Corrected notional calculation in `risk.py:221` to properly account for leverage
- Before: `notional = size * equity` (missing leverage multiplication)
- After: `notional = size * equity * leverage`
- Impact: Leverage caps now enforce correctly, preventing over-leveraged positions

**Sortino Ratio Calculation**
- Fixed: Sortino downside deviation calculation in `tournament.py:104`
- Before: Used `len(downside_returns)` in denominator (incorrect)
- After: Uses `len(self.returns)` for proper downside semi-deviation
- Impact: Sortino ratios now match academic definition and compare correctly

**Leverage Alignment**
- Fixed: Gross leverage default in `config/qts.risk.json:10` reduced from 1.5x to 1.0x
- Rationale: Aligns with conservative risk posture and prevents cascading liquidations
- Impact: Portfolio-wide leverage cannot exceed 1.0x (sum of all positions)

**Execution Permissions**
- Fixed: Added `chmod +x` to tournament runner scripts for proper execution
- Files: `plugins/tournament-runner/run_tournament.sh`, `plugins/tournament-runner/check_promotion_gate.sh`
- Impact: Scripts can now be executed directly without permission errors

#### Reproducibility Improvements (Commit 4)

**Deterministic Simulation**
- Changed: Tournament now uses per-variant deterministic RNG seeding
- Implementation: `rng = random.Random(hash(variant.name) % (2**32))`
- Impact: Same variant produces identical results across runs for A/B testing

**Defensive Guards**
- Added: Validation guards in `tournament.py` to prevent division by zero
- Added: Bounds checking for equity curve calculations
- Impact: Tournament runs complete successfully even with edge-case inputs

---

### Fixed

- **Critical**: Notional calculation now includes leverage (prevents under-estimation)
- **Critical**: Sortino ratio formula corrected (downside deviation denominator)
- **Important**: ExecutionResult success flag logic (prevents false positives)
- **Important**: Gross leverage cap reduced to 1.0x (conservative risk)
- **Minor**: Tournament script permissions (executable flags)

---

### Security

#### 3-Layer Trading Approval

**Layer 1: Code-level Approval**
- Live trading disabled by default in all executors
- Requires explicit `enabled=True` flag in code

**Layer 2: Plugin Permission**
- Plugin manifest must declare `"trading": "live"`
- Paper trading is default: `"trading": "paper"`

**Layer 3: Manual Approval**
- 4-week tournament promotion gate must pass:
  - Sharpe > 1.2, MDD < 10%, hit rate > 45%
  - Trades/week > 20, zero violations
- Manual review and approval required
- Guarded rollout: Start with 1% of paper trading size

**Plugin Security Framework**
- Validator flags unpinned remote sources in existing plugins (uses `/main/` instead of commit SHA)
- All new plugins require pinned sources with integrity hashes
- Existing plugins grandfathered but should be updated incrementally

---

### Known Limitations

#### Tournament Simulation (v1)

**Current Implementation**
- Uses simplified mock simulation with random trades
- Does NOT integrate with real trading pipeline or historical data
- Trade outcomes based on heuristic probabilities adjusted by TP multiplier

**Rationale**
- Real integration requires:
  - Historical data feed (OHLCV + order book)
  - Trading pipeline refactoring for replay mode
  - Time-series framework for backtesting
- v1 focuses on establishing tournament infrastructure and promotion gates

**Future Enhancement**
- Consider full pipeline integration for v2.0.0
- Add historical data replay mode
- Implement realistic slippage models based on liquidity data
