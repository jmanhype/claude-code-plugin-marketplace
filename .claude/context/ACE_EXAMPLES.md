# ACE Context Engineering - Complete Examples

This document provides end-to-end walkthroughs of the ACE (Agentic Context Engineering) cycle with concrete examples.

---

## Example 1: Complete ACE Cycle - Adding a Plugin

### Scenario

User asks: "Add a new plugin for syntax highlighting to the marketplace"

### Phase 1: RETRIEVE

**Task analysis:**
- Tags: `domain.plugin_marketplace`, `json`, `validation`, `tool.write`

**Retrieved bullets:**

```json
{
  "retrieved": [
    {
      "id": "bullet-2025-10-25-006",
      "title": "Validate JSON files before committing in plugin marketplace projects",
      "tags": ["domain.plugin_marketplace", "validation", "json", "git.commit"],
      "helpful_count": 5
    },
    {
      "id": "bullet-2025-10-25-002",
      "title": "Use specialized file tools instead of Bash commands",
      "tags": ["tool.bash", "tool.write", "best_practice"],
      "helpful_count": 3
    }
  ],
  "retrieval_rationale": "Task involves creating JSON files in plugin marketplace, so validation and file tool guidance are relevant"
}
```

### Phase 2: GENERATE

**Execution:**

1. Create `plugins/syntax-highlighting/` directory
2. Write `metadata.json` (using Write tool per bullet-2025-10-25-002)
3. Write `README.md`
4. Validate JSON (per bullet-2025-10-25-006)
5. Update `marketplace.json`
6. Validate marketplace.json

**Generator output:**

```json
{
  "final_answer": "Successfully added syntax-highlighting plugin with metadata.json, README.md, and updated marketplace.json. All JSON validated.",
  "used_bullet_ids": [
    "bullet-2025-10-25-002",
    "bullet-2025-10-25-006"
  ],
  "observations": [
    "Write tool worked well for new files",
    "Validation caught missing 'license' field before commit",
    "marketplace.json update required manual edit - no automation"
  ],
  "answer_confidence": "high",
  "missing_guidance": [
    "No bullet about marketplace.json schema or required fields",
    "No guidance about plugin directory naming conventions"
  ]
}
```

### Phase 3: REFLECT

**Reflection analysis:**

- ‚úÖ Both bullets helpful - increment counters
- ‚ùå Missing guidance on marketplace.json structure
- ‚ùå Missing guidance on plugin naming conventions
- üí° Could add bullet about plugin creation workflow

**Proposed deltas:**

```json
{
  "new_bullets": [
    {
      "id": "bullet-2025-10-25-014",
      "title": "Plugin marketplace.json requires specific schema for each plugin entry",
      "content": "When adding plugins to marketplace.json, each entry must include: name (string, unique), version (semver), description (string), author (object with name and optional email/url), tags (array of strings), repository (optional URL), license (string, e.g., 'MIT'). Validate against schemas/plugin.schema.json before committing to prevent CI failures.",
      "tags": ["domain.plugin_marketplace", "json", "schema", "validation"],
      "evidence": [
        {
          "type": "execution",
          "ref": "task-add-syntax-highlighting-plugin",
          "note": "Had to manually check existing entries to understand required fields"
        }
      ],
      "confidence": "high",
      "scope": "project"
    },
    {
      "id": "bullet-2025-10-25-015",
      "title": "Plugin directories should use kebab-case naming",
      "content": "Plugin directory names in the marketplace should use kebab-case (lowercase with hyphens). Example: 'syntax-highlighting', 'code-formatter', 'ai-assistant'. This maintains consistency across the marketplace and avoids case-sensitivity issues across platforms. The directory name should match the plugin's 'name' field in metadata.json.",
      "tags": ["domain.plugin_marketplace", "naming", "convention"],
      "evidence": [
        {
          "type": "execution",
          "ref": "projects/CLAUDE.md",
          "note": "Project conventions specify kebab-case for plugin directories"
        }
      ],
      "confidence": "high",
      "scope": "project"
    }
  ],
  "counters": [
    {
      "id": "bullet-2025-10-25-002",
      "helpful_delta": 1,
      "evidence": {
        "type": "execution",
        "ref": "task-add-syntax-highlighting-plugin",
        "note": "Write tool used successfully for creating plugin files"
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "bullet-2025-10-25-006",
      "helpful_delta": 1,
      "evidence": {
        "type": "validation",
        "ref": "task-add-syntax-highlighting-plugin",
        "note": "JSON validation caught missing license field before commit"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Phase 4: CURATE

**Deduplication check:**

- Search existing bullets for "marketplace.json" ‚Üí None found
- Search existing bullets for "kebab-case" or "naming" ‚Üí None found
- Search for similar schema validation ‚Üí bullet-2025-10-25-006 exists but is generic, new bullet is specific

**Normalized delta:**

```json
{
  "delta_id": "delta-2025-10-25-001",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-25T14:30:00Z",
  "author": "agent",
  "rationale": "Captured plugin marketplace-specific patterns discovered during plugin addition task. Two new bullets address schema requirements and naming conventions that were not previously documented.",
  "task_context": "Adding syntax-highlighting plugin to marketplace",
  "reviewed": false,
  "new_bullets": [
    // ... same as above
  ],
  "counters": [
    // ... same as above
  ]
}
```

**Validation:**

```bash
$ python scripts/validate_delta.py delta-2025-10-25-001.json --playbook playbook.json

=== Delta Validation Results ===

Delta file: delta-2025-10-25-001.json
Playbook: playbook.json

‚úì Delta is valid!

Operations: 2 new bullets, 2 counter updates
```

### Phase 5: MERGE

**Apply delta:**

1. Load playbook.json
2. Update counters:
   - bullet-2025-10-25-002: helpful_count 3 ‚Üí 4
   - bullet-2025-10-25-006: helpful_count 5 ‚Üí 6
3. Add bullet-2025-10-25-014 and bullet-2025-10-25-015
4. Update metadata:
   - total_bullets: 12 ‚Üí 14
   - active_bullets: 12 ‚Üí 14
   - last_curated: 2025-10-25T14:30:00Z
5. Save playbook.json

**Result:**

Playbook now contains 14 active bullets, including domain-specific guidance for plugin marketplace that will help with future plugin additions.

## Example 2: Reflection After Failure

### Scenario

Task failed: Git push returned 403 error

### Phase 1-2: RETRIEVE & GENERATE

**Retrieved bullet:**

```json
{
  "id": "bullet-2025-10-25-003",
  "title": "Git push requires branch names starting with 'claude/' to avoid 403 errors",
  "helpful_count": 0,
  "harmful_count": 0
}
```

**Execution:**

Agent attempted: `git push origin feature-branch`
Result: HTTP 403 Forbidden

**Why it failed:**

Agent retrieved the bullet but IGNORED the guidance (didn't follow it).

### Phase 3: REFLECT

**Reflection:**

```json
{
  "proposed_deltas": {
    "counters": [
      {
        "id": "bullet-2025-10-25-003",
        "harmful_delta": 1,
        "evidence": {
          "type": "error_log",
          "ref": "git-push-failure-001",
          "note": "Bullet was retrieved but guidance was not followed, leading to 403 error"
        }
      }
    ],
    "edits": [
      {
        "id": "bullet-2025-10-25-003",
        "set": {
          "title": "CRITICAL: Git push requires branch names starting with 'claude/' to avoid 403",
          "tags": ["tool.bash", "git.push", "error_prevention", "critical", "project", "must_follow"]
        },
        "rationale": "Upgrading criticality to emphasize this is a hard requirement, not optional guidance"
      }
    ]
  },
  "reflection_notes": "Bullet was retrieved but not followed. Need to emphasize criticality and add 'must_follow' tag to ensure it's not skipped."
}
```

**Lesson learned:**

Even when bullets are retrieved, they must be APPLIED. High-stakes rules need clearer signaling (CRITICAL, must_follow tag).

## Example 3: Merging Redundant Bullets

### Scenario

Discovered two bullets both addressing JSON validation:

**Bullet A:**

```json
{
  "id": "bullet-2025-10-25-006",
  "title": "Validate JSON files before committing in plugin marketplace projects",
  "content": "Always validate JSON files (metadata.json, marketplace.json) before committing...",
  "tags": ["domain.plugin_marketplace", "validation", "json", "best_practice", "project"],
  "helpful_count": 6,
  "harmful_count": 0
}
```

**Bullet B (hypothetical):**

```json
{
  "id": "bullet-2025-09-15-042",
  "title": "Use jq to validate JSON syntax before git commit",
  "content": "Run 'jq . file.json' before committing JSON files to catch syntax errors...",
  "tags": ["json", "validation", "tool.bash"],
  "helpful_count": 2,
  "harmful_count": 0
}
```

### Analysis

**Similarity:**
- Both about JSON validation before commit
- Overlapping tags: ["json", "validation"]
- Similar intent

**Differences:**
- Bullet A is plugin-marketplace specific
- Bullet B suggests specific tool (jq)
- Different scopes

### Curator Decision

**Option 1: Merge** (if bullets are truly redundant)

```json
{
  "merges": [
    {
      "keep_id": "bullet-2025-10-25-006",
      "merge_ids": ["bullet-2025-09-15-042"],
      "rationale": "Both address JSON validation before commit. Combining to create comprehensive guidance with specific tool recommendation.",
      "merged_content": "Always validate JSON files before committing. Use validation scripts, schemas, or 'jq . file.json' to check syntax. Common issues: trailing commas, unescaped strings, missing brackets. For plugin marketplace, validate against schemas/plugin.schema.json. Validation prevents CI failures and saves time."
    }
  ]
}
```

**Option 2: Keep Both** (if bullets serve different purposes)

No merge. Instead, add link:

```json
{
  "edits": [
    {
      "id": "bullet-2025-10-25-006",
      "set": {
        "links": ["bullet-2025-09-15-042"]
      },
      "rationale": "Link to related bullet about JSON validation tools"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Recommendation:** Keep both if:
- Different scopes (project vs global)
- Different levels of detail (high-level vs tool-specific)
- Different contexts where each applies

Merge if:
- Truly redundant
- One supersedes the other
- Causing confusion

---

## Example 4: Deprecating Obsolete Guidance

### Scenario

Project migrated from npm to pnpm. Old bullet says "use npm install".

**Old bullet:**

```json
{
  "id": "bullet-2024-06-10-018",
  "title": "Run npm install after pulling changes to package.json",
  "content": "When package.json changes are pulled, always run 'npm install' to sync dependencies...",
  "tags": ["tool.bash", "npm", "dependency_management"],
  "helpful_count": 15,
  "harmful_count": 0
}
```

**New bullet:**

```json
{
  "id": "bullet-2025-10-25-016",
  "title": "Run pnpm install after pulling changes to package.json",
  "content": "When package.json changes are pulled, always run 'pnpm install' to sync dependencies. This project uses pnpm for faster installs and better disk efficiency...",
  "tags": ["tool.bash", "pnpm", "dependency_management"],
  "helpful_count": 0,
  "harmful_count": 0
}
```

### Delta

```json
{
  "delta_id": "delta-2025-10-25-002",
  "rationale": "Project migrated from npm to pnpm. Deprecating npm guidance and adding pnpm replacement.",
  "task_context": "Package manager migration",
  "new_bullets": [
    {
      "id": "bullet-2025-10-25-016",
      // ... as above
    }
  ],
  "deprecations": [
    {
      "id": "bullet-2024-06-10-018",
      "reason": "Project migrated from npm to pnpm. npm install no longer used.",
      "replacement_id": "bullet-2025-10-25-016"
    }
  ]
}
```

**After merge:**

- bullet-2024-06-10-018: status = "deprecated", points to replacement
- bullet-2025-10-25-016: status = "active"
- Both preserved in playbook for historical reference

---

## Example 5: Low Confidence Bullet

### Scenario

Agent suspects pattern but lacks strong evidence.

**Observation:**

"It seems like Grep might be faster with --type flag instead of --glob, but I only tried once."

### Proposed Bullet (Low Confidence)

```json
{
  "id": "bullet-2025-10-25-017",
  "title": "Prefer Grep --type over --glob for performance",
  "content": "When searching specific file types, use --type flag (e.g., --type js) instead of --glob (e.g., --glob '*.js'). The --type flag may be more optimized in ripgrep. However, this needs more testing to confirm performance difference.",
  "tags": ["tool.grep", "performance", "low_confidence"],
  "evidence": [
    {
      "type": "low_confidence",
      "ref": "single-observation-2025-10-25",
      "note": "Observed faster result once, but not rigorously tested"
    }
  ],
  "confidence": "low",
  "scope": "global",
  "helpful_count": 0,
  "harmful_count": 0
}
```

**Strategy:**

1. Add bullet with `confidence: "low"` and `low_confidence` tag
2. Use it tentatively in future tasks
3. Track helpful/harmful counts
4. If proven helpful (count > 5), upgrade to `confidence: "medium"`
5. If proven harmful (harmful > helpful), deprecate

**Progressive Validation:**

- Start: confidence=low, helpful=0, harmful=0
- After 10 uses: helpful=7, harmful=1 ‚Üí upgrade to medium
- After 30 uses: helpful=28, harmful=0 ‚Üí upgrade to high

---

## Example 6: Counter-Only Delta (Simple Update)

### Scenario

Used several bullets successfully, no new patterns discovered.

### Delta

```json
{
  "delta_id": "delta-2025-10-25-003",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-25T16:00:00Z",
  "rationale": "Standard task execution with existing guidance. Updating effectiveness counters.",
  "task_context": "Fixed bug in validation logic",
  "counters": [
    {"id": "bullet-2025-10-25-001", "helpful_delta": 1},
    {"id": "bullet-2025-10-25-012", "helpful_delta": 1},
    {"id": "bullet-2025-10-25-007", "helpful_delta": 1}
  ]
}
```

**When to use counter-only deltas:**

‚úÖ Task completed successfully with existing guidance
‚úÖ No new patterns emerged
‚úÖ Want to track bullet effectiveness
‚úÖ Simple, low-risk update

---

## Example 7: Edit to Improve Existing Bullet

### Scenario

Bullet exists but is vague. After using it, agent can make it more specific.

**Before:**

```json
{
  "id": "bullet-2025-10-25-010",
  "title": "Grep requires exact escaping of literal braces",
  "content": "When searching for braces, you need to escape them.",
  "tags": ["tool.grep", "regex"]
}
```

**After using it:** Agent realizes it's specifically about ripgrep vs grep, and needs examples.

### Delta

```json
{
  "edits": [
    {
      "id": "bullet-2025-10-25-010",
      "set": {
        "title": "Grep requires exact escaping of literal braces for Go/Rust interface syntax",
        "content": "When searching for code with literal braces (e.g., Go's 'interface{}', Rust's 'struct {}'), you must escape the braces in Grep patterns because it uses ripgrep (not grep) syntax. Use 'interface\\{\\}' to find 'interface{}'. Also note: Grep matches single lines by default; use multiline: true for patterns that span lines. Common error: forgetting to escape causes pattern to match nothing.",
        "tags": ["tool.grep", "regex", "edge_case", "go", "rust"]
      },
      "rationale": "Expanded with specific examples (Go, Rust), clarified ripgrep vs grep difference, added multiline note, and included common error. Makes bullet much more actionable."
    }
  ]
}
```

**Result:** Bullet is more specific, has examples, and is easier to apply correctly.

## Common Patterns Summary

### When to Add New Bullets

‚úÖ Discovered edge case not covered
‚úÖ Found tool usage recipe that worked well
‚úÖ Identified common error pattern
‚úÖ Learned domain-specific convention
‚úÖ Found gap during task execution

### When to Update Counters

‚úÖ After every task where bullets were used
‚úÖ When bullet helped avoid error (helpful+1)
‚úÖ When bullet led to wrong approach (harmful+1)
‚úÖ Batch counter updates for efficiency

### When to Edit Bullets

‚úÖ Vague ‚Üí Specific (add examples, clarify)
‚úÖ Incomplete ‚Üí Complete (add missing context)
‚úÖ Wrong ‚Üí Corrected (fix errors)
‚úÖ Outdated ‚Üí Current (update for changes)

### When to Merge Bullets

‚úÖ True duplicates (same intent, same tags)
‚úÖ One bullet supersedes another
‚úÖ Combining creates clearer guidance
‚ö†Ô∏è Be conservative - prefer keeping both if uncertain

### When to Deprecate Bullets

‚úÖ Proven wrong (harmful >> helpful)
‚úÖ Technology/API changed
‚úÖ Pattern no longer applies
‚úÖ Superseded by better guidance

---

## Best Practices Learned

1. **Start with retrieval** - Always query bullets before execution
2. **Track usage** - Note which bullets you actually use
3. **Be specific** - Generic advice is low-value
4. **Include evidence** - Ground bullets in execution reality
5. **Tag well** - Good tags enable good retrieval
6. **Link related bullets** - Build knowledge graph
7. **Progressive confidence** - Start low, upgrade with evidence
8. **Preserve history** - Deprecate, don't delete
9. **Validate before merge** - Catch errors early
10. **Review high-impact changes** - Get user sign-off

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

‚ùå Adding bullets without evidence ("I think maybe...")
‚ùå Merging bullets that serve different contexts
‚ùå Deleting deprecated bullets (archive instead)
‚ùå Generic, vague content ("be careful", "think about...")
‚ùå Not tracking which bullets were used
‚ùå Skipping validation step
‚ùå Monolithic rewrites instead of incremental deltas
‚ùå Not linking related bullets
‚ùå Ignoring harmful_count signals
‚ùå Not updating counters regularly
